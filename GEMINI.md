# Gemini Agent Workspace

## Directory Overview

This directory serves as the workspace for the Gemini AI agent. It is used to store configuration, logs, and other relevant files generated or managed by the agent during its interactions and tasks.

## Key Files

*   **`GEMINI.md`**: This file provides instructional context for the Gemini agent, outlining the project's purpose, structure, and any specific guidelines for interaction.
*   **`log.md`**: This file is used by the Gemini agent to log its operations, changes made to the codebase, and other significant events during its execution.

## Usage

This directory is primarily managed by the Gemini AI agent. Users interact with the agent, and the agent utilizes this workspace to maintain context, record actions, and store necessary information for its operations.

All log entries in `log.md` will include a sequence number and a timestamp in the format: `[Sequence] [YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS] - Log Message`.
