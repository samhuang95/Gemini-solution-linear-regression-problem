[1] [2025-09-29 10:00:00] - Created `GEMINI.md` with an overview of the Gemini Agent Workspace, including directory overview, key files, and usage.
[2] [2025-09-29 10:00:00] - Modified `app.py` to replace `R²` with `R^2` in the R-squared print statement to fix `UnicodeEncodeError`.
[3] [2025-09-29 10:05:00] - Updated `GEMINI.md` to include the new logging rule for `log.md` in the 'Usage' section.
[4] [2025-09-29 10:10:00] - Created `requirements.txt` with `numpy`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn` as dependencies.
[5] [2025-09-29 10:15:00] - Created `streamlit_app.py` to convert the linear regression project into a Streamlit application with user-defined parameters for data generation.
[6] [2025-09-29 10:20:00] - Attempted to run `streamlit_app.py` in the background using `python -m streamlit run streamlit_app.py --browser.gatherUsageStats false` and instructed the user to check `http://localhost:8501`.
[7] [2025-09-29 10:25:00] - Modified `streamlit_app.py` to configure `matplotlib` to use 'Microsoft YaHei' font for Chinese character display and set `axes.unicode_minus` to `False`.
[8] [2025-09-29 10:30:00] - Re-attempted to run `streamlit_app.py` in the background after applying font configuration, instructing the user to check `http://localhost:8501`.
[9] [2025-09-29 10:35:00] - Modified `streamlit_app.py` to implement outlier detection using the IQR method on residuals, highlight outliers in the plot, and annotate them with their (X, y) values.
[10] [2025-09-29 10:40:00] - Re-attempted to run `streamlit_app.py` in the background after implementing outlier detection and annotation, instructing the user to check `http://localhost:8501`.}
[11] [2025-09-29 10:45:00] - Modified `streamlit_app.py` to display the top 5 outliers (X, Y, residuals) in a sortable table using `st.dataframe`.
[12] [2025-09-29 10:50:00] - Re-attempted to run `streamlit_app.py` in the background after implementing the display of top 5 outliers table, instructing the user to check `http://localhost:8501`.
[13] [2025-09-29 10:55:00] - Reordered sections in `streamlit_app.py` to place the 'Top 5 離群值' table after the '線性迴歸結果視覺化' plot.
